That is, a user doesn't need a reason to use a procedure. They're often looking for the how in a situation. Here are some rules of thumb for writing effective procedures: Each action is a numbered step. Results do not take a number as they are not a step. If there is only one step, use a bullet, and not the number 1. Active voice is easier to understand. Use it! Use second person. You're talking to the user, so second person is best. You can even use the word You in your instructions (like I just did). Present tense. Most of the time users read the instructions when they're in the middle of trying to do something or to solve a problem. No more than 8 steps. If you require more, break the procedure up into a grouped set. Include images and videos if they help the user. Even a schematic drawing can help when showing how to install hardware. Use sub-steps sparingly, and use bullets or a, b, c, etc. Don't mix them! Also, don't use Input to show typing, or another way of entering information.

Don't use semicolons or a comma after points in a bulleted list. Include a period at the end of the bullet only if that point is a complete sentence. If one bullet point requires a period, all should have a period. For example: When you go to the store, please buy: Milk Apples Cod cakes When you leave the house: Please buy apples, bananas, and cod cakes. Fill the car with gas. I need these things done: Shopping. Weeding. Water the plants if they need it. Colons Capitalize the first word after a colon if a colon introduces a direct quotation or the first word after a colon is a proper noun. For example: The dolphins left a note that said: \"So long and thanks for all the fish!\" There are two types of articles: Reviews and Research. Semicolons Use semicolons sparingly. They are difficult to see on some hand-held devices. Semicolons can sometimes confuse non-native English speakers. For example, in Greek you end a question with a semicolon. Try rewriting the sentence or paragraph to make it more readable. Commas Use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction. For example: Please buy milk, apples, and cod cakes. Dashes When offsetting a phrase with dashes you should use the longer em dash (\u2014) with a space on either side of the dash. For example: We emphasize specific, customer-centered workflows, and \u2014 whenever possible \u2014 we preserve your current workflow. Although you should use words instead of symbols, in some contexts you may use an \"en dash\" to convey a range of numbers. For example, both 10\u201320 footnotes and 10 to 20 footnotes are acceptable options. We assign 2\u20135 people to each implementation team. Quotes These quotations are correctly punctuated: \"Would you like a milk shake?\" he asked. \"I don't like milk shakes,\" she said. \"You know I detest milk shakes.\" He paused before saying, \"Well, how about a Pepsi?\" Spaces Sentences should always be separated by a single space. Never two spaces. Ampersands or plus signs Use and instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they're part of a command, an official title, or a company name. For example, Hoefler & Co. Slashes Avoid using the slash / symbol. Replace it with words or commas as appropriate.

Screen shots are easy to produce and format using SnagIt and other tools. Rules of thumb for images Address the user: Focus on illustrating or drawing attention to specific points you want them to understand. Be concise: Don't go crazy. Use the images to enhance, not overwhelm the document. Be conscious: Use real examples with the most current software. Be smart: You don't need to include an entire interface. If you're describing options, you can show only that part of the dialog. Common uses of imagery Screenshots can go a long way in explaining design and user-experience techniques. Use them to show the user the steps involved or to give examples showing them what you're talking about. Images online An image that spans the full width of a web page should be no more than 800 pixels wide. Captions aren't necessary in procedures. If your content may appear on hand-held devices, use responsive images. That is, provide different image sizes depending on the device. Most online delivery software nowadays can take an image and perform automatic resizing on the fly. Use the Light setting instead of Dark for the interface. Dark images are harder to view when reduced. If your delivery software allows the user to zoom an image with a mouseover, that's a great solution. Copyrighted images Don't use them, even in internal documents. Don't alter a copyrighted image and use it. Instead, search for and use public domain CC0 Images Accessibility While you may not be required to follow Section 508 guidelines, some clients might be required to comply with Section 508. They may expect or require vendors to comply as well. The broad requirement is that any information presented in an image must also be presented in an alternative format (for people who cannot view images). The W3C Web Accessibility initiative is a good resource for all web accessibility issues. Every image presented online must have alt text describing the image. Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the alt text. Most screen readers already add Image of when reading out an image, so alt text like Image of Edit Citation dialog box is redundant because screen readers will read it Image of image of edit citation dialog box . Try to limit alt text to 15 to 25 words. if you need to have a longer explanation, add it to the page as a description for the action involved. When captioning an image, don't add additional context or information. Don't merely repeat what the user sees by looking at the image. Captions should increase understanding.","title":"Images"},{"location":"images/#images","text":"Graphics and other visual elements can clarify what you've written.

The broad requirement is that any information presented in an image must also be presented in an alternative format (for people who cannot view images). The W3C Web Accessibility initiative is a good resource for all web accessibility issues. Every image presented online must have alt text describing the image. Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the alt text. Most screen readers already add Image of when reading out an image, so alt text like Image of Edit Citation dialog box is redundant because screen readers will read it Image of image of edit citation dialog box .
