#Numbers and percentages

## Numbers

Generally speaking, I follow the guidelines outlined in the <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/style-guide/numbers" target="_blank">Microsoft
Writing Style Guide</a>![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png). However, if the document is for a more general audience and isn't primarily instructional, I follow <a href="http://login.chicagomanualofstyle.org/action/login" target="_new"> The Chicago Manual of Style, 18th edition</a>![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png).

In body copy, spell out numbers zero through nine, and use numerals for numbers 10 and greater. This is true of ordinal numbers, as well. Spell out first to ninth, and then use 10th or greater.

In titles, subheadings, and interface labels, use numerals instead of spelling out numbers. For example, *10 tips for using URLs* or *6 steps to better dynamic formulas*. This promotes ease of reading and scannability. With titles and headings, it's easier for readers to scan numerals than it is for them to scan written-out numbers.

## Dates

Use the full, four-digit year unless you're writing something more informal. Then it's okay to use an abbreviated form. For example,*We're thankful printing technology isn't stuck in the '80s!*

Do not use date abbreviations such as *10/2/25*. In the US,Â we read that as October 2, 2025. In other parts of the world, it is 10 February 2025. 

## Percentages

Spell out *percent* in most cases. However, you can use the percent sign (%) in these cases to help the reader scan and understand more easily:

* **Tables and in technical or scientific writing** For example: *If the progress meter sits at 60% or lower for more than 20 minutes, close the program and start again*
* **Headings and subheadings** For example: *Clearing 100% of all errors*
* **Interface labels** *50% saturation*
* **Captions** *75% of the work is marked Done*
