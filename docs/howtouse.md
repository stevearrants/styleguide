# How to use this guide

## Introduction

Use this guide to create content that is clear and easy to understand, serving the reader's needs. Too much technical documentation talks *at* the user rather than *with* them. Most writing leaves users frustrated by information that doesnâ€™t give them what they came for. Instead of telling them the time, it tells them how to build a clock.

I wanted to address this and offer several common-sense guidelines about writing for a diverse audience. Using this guide can help you have a conversation with your audience. Get to know them and incorporate their experience and feedback into the process. Always communicate in a clear, consistent, and logical manner.


## Use this guide as a reference. 

If you have a corporate style guide, use that one. If you don't have a standard, take the content here and adapt it to your needs. 

Find the topic you're looking for in the table of contents or search by keyword. Use it the way that makes sense to you.

## Remember!

Use this guide and adapt it to your group's needs. This is just a guide. If a section isn't relevant to you and your team, ignore it. If
something is missing, <a href="mailto:sarrants@gmail.com" target="_blank">let me know</a> and I'll add it.
