# Headings and titles

Most people scan the page and make decisions based on headings. Make
them active and descriptive.

## Find the right keywords

Stuck for keywords? Ask co-workers what keywords they would expect to use. Ask end users.
What you're calling the subject of your page might not be what your
users are calling it. While your online site may use a full-text search,
some systems have special matching rules. 

## Optimize the content

Once you know the most popular keywords, incorporate them in:

* Titles
* Headings
* Introductions and summaries
* Chapter and section titles
* Metadata descriptions
