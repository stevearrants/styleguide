# Headings and titles

Most people scan the page and make decisions based on headings. Make them active and descriptive.

## Find the right keywords

Stuck for keywords? Ask co-workers what keywords they would expect to use. Ask end users. What you're referring to as the subject of your page may not be what your users are referring to it as. While your online site may use a full-text search, some systems have special matching rules in place. 

## Optimize the content

Once you know the most popular keywords, incorporate them in:

* Titles
* Headings
* Introductions and summaries
* Chapter and section titles
* Metadata descriptions
