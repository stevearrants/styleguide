# Principles for user content

## Always, always, ALWAYS start with user needs


Write in a way that suits the situation. Ask yourself the following: 

* Who am I writing for? 
* What do they need to know? 
* What are their constraints and environment?
* How can I help?

Help people find the information they need quickly and easily. Guide them through the journey.

## Make it simple for the user

* Use plain language and simple sentences.
* Be clear, not clever. This isn't fiction.
* When you write, start as if you’re speaking to your parents. Then adjust for user needs.
* Write for the audience, not yourself.

Developers, end-users, customers, and all readers have complex experiences and backgrounds. Respect that.

> Know the audience. I can't stress this enough! Talk to them. Don't ask what they *want*. Observe and give them what they *need*.

## Build trust with your audience

* Talk like a person, not a computer.
* Don't sugarcoat a problem. Tell the truth.
* Use positive language and concrete, real-world examples.
* Start small and build big.

Does your content work for users? Don't be afraid to rethink and rewrite.

Write a draft. Test on your users and readers. Examine their feedback.
Refine. Make it better, test it out, gather feedback, and keep improving it.
