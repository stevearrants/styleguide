# Punctuation

## Bulleted lists

Capitalize the first word of every bullet. Don't use semicolons or a comma after points in a bulleted list. Include a period at the end of the bullet
only if that point is a complete sentence. If one bullet point requires a period, all should have a period. For example:

> When you go to the store, please buy:
>
> * Milk
> * Apples
> * Cod cakes

> When you leave the house:
>
> * Please buy apples, bananas, and cod cakes.
> * Fill the car with gas.
>
> I need these things done:
>
> * Shopping.
> * Weeding.
> * Water the plants if they need it.

## Colons

Capitalize the first word after a colon if a colon introduces a direct
quotation or the first word after a colon is a proper noun. For example:

> The dolphins left a note that said: "So long and thanks for all the
> fish!"
>
> There are two types of articles: Reviews and Research.

## Semicolons

Use semicolons sparingly. They are difficult to see on some hand-held devices. Semicolons can sometimes cause confusion for non-native English speakers.
For example, in Greek, you end a question with a semicolon. 

Try rewriting the sentence or paragraph to make it more readable.

## Commas

Use the serial comma (sometimes called the Oxford comma). In a list of three or more, include a comma before the conjunction. For example:
*Please buy milk, apples, and cod cakes.*

## Dashes

When offsetting a phrase with dashes, you should use the longer em dash (&mdash;) with a space on either side of the dash. For example:

*We emphasize specific, customer-centered workflows, and &mdash; whenever possible &mdash; we preserve your current workflow.*

Although you should use words instead of symbols, in some contexts you may use an "en dash" to convey a range of numbers. For example, both 
*10&ndash;20 footnotes* and *10 to 20 footnotes* are acceptable options.

> *We assign 2&ndash;5 people to each implementation team.*

## Quotes

These quotations are correctly punctuated:

> "Would you like a milkshake?" he asked.
>
> "I don't like milkshakes," she said. "You know I detest milkshakes."
>
> He paused before saying, "Well, how about a Pepsi?"

## Spaces

A single space should always separate sentences. Never two
spaces.

## Ampersands or plus signs

Use *and* instead of an ampersand or plus sign, unless they're part of a command, an official title, or a  company name. For example, *Hoefler & Co.*

## Slashes

Avoid using the slash */* symbol. Replace it with words or commas as appropriate. If you must use a /, or if your corporate style guide requires it, do not place a space before/after the slash.
