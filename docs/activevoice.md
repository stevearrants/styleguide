# Active voice

Be concise and direct. Active voice supports these goals, and it also makes your content more engaging. Active voice can help the reader 
easily identify the subject of the sentence. In the following example, the person who submits the form is essential information. Omitting that leads to a confusing and impersonal sentence.

> Passive: The Remote Work benefits form must be submitted to the appropriate representative.

> Active: Submit the Remote Work benefits form to Human Resources.

The passive de-emphasizes who should take an action. Documents written in the passive voice have more words, and these texts are harder to
follow.

> Passive: The error notice should be saved in your email, as it will be required for future inquiries.
>
> Active: Save the error notice in your email for later use.

When in doubt, start with the verb or start with the actor and then the verb.

## When to use the passive voice

There are always exceptions. Avoid using the passive voice in a way that makes actions seem like they occur magically, without anyone taking action. Your documentation should always make it clear who (or what) is acting.

In some cases, you can soften an error message with passive voice.

Rewording either of these sentences with the active voice complicates the sentence or pulls focus away from its main point:

> Responses sent from iPaaS.com include **Waiting for Support** and **Closed**.
>
> Support is required to respond to requests within 4 working hours.
