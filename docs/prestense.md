# Present tense

Present tense is easier to read and understand
than past or future tense. And simple verbs are easier to understand than
complex verbs, such as those in the progressive or perfect tense. Remember that
most (all?) users read while in the middle of a procedure. They're trying to troubleshoot 
or fix a problem. I've yet to meet a user who reads the documentation for fun.

Especially for procedures, think of the user as they follow the steps
--- they're "in the now."

> As you work, iPaaS warns you of potential errors.

instead of

> While working, iPaaS will stop if you have made an error.
