# Creating good screenshots

Screenshots are essential for almost any documentation as they can help users by providing a quick visual cue. Nobody wants to read or write a lot of text. Why spend so much time describing a process that can fit in a couple of screenshots?

When taking screenshots, you need to consider several factors, including image size, image quality, information privacy, text readability, and more.

## Ground rules
Figure out precisely *what* you are doing the screenshots for, and this will allow you to capture just the details you need. Take some time to ensure that no UI element is left outside the frame if it is of importance. Remember, a user should understand where the element in question is in the UI to be able to find it. In this screenshot, it's impossible to understand which tab is open without reading some explanatory text.

Instead, put it in context. You can see the commands, but where are they? As you see below, the user can see that it is part of the
**Project** group.

Thinking through helps a lot, especially when doing a series of screenshots to depict some steps. A mistake at the very beginning can ruin the user's experience; plan it before you start. Create the environment before taking any action, be mindful of potential pitfalls, and provide users with a heads-up when necessary.
