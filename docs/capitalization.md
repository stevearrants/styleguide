# Capitalization

## Follow a consistent capitalization scheme

Inconsistent spellings and capitalization are sloppy writing and confuses readers. 
Follow these capitalization guidelines:

*  Capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and companies.
*  Don't capitalize *agile* or *open source*, unless either opens a sentence.
*  Don't capitalize *submit* as an action, but do capitalize it if it is the name of an interface item or the first word of a sentence.

When you're deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, remember title case is more formal. 
It can help clarify that you're speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a
form, office, or person). But overuse can be confusing. Readers seeing lots of 
capitalized nouns can Get Lost in a Sea Of Words.

Capitalization in headings
--------

Headlines, page titles, subheads, and similar content should follow
sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

-   Using the Insert Filter command
-   Implementer roles and responsibilities

If your company has a different standard, follow that.
