# Images

Graphics and other visual elements can clarify what you've written. 
Screen shots are easy to produce and format using [SnagIt](https://www.techsmith.com/snagit/) ![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png) and other tools.

### Rules of thumb for images
* **Address the user:** Focus on illustrating or drawing attention to specific points you want them to understand.
* **Be concise:** Don't go crazy. Use the images to enhance, not overwhelm the document.
* **Be conscious:** Use real examples with the most current software.
* **Be smart:** You don't need to include an entire interface. If you're describing options, 
you can show only that part of the dialog.

## Common uses of imagery

Screenshots can go a long way in explaining design and user-experience
techniques. Use them to show the user the steps involved or to 
give examples showing them what you're talking about.

### Images online
An image that spans the full width of a web page should be no more than
800 pixels wide. Captions aren't necessary in procedures.

If your content may appear on hand-held devices, use responsive images.
That is, provide different image sizes depending on the device. Most  
online delivery software nowadays can take 
an image and perform automatic resizing on the fly. 

Use the **Light** setting instead of **Dark** for the interface. Dark images are 
harder to view when reduced. If your delivery software allows the user 
to zoom an image with a mouseover, that's a great solution.

## Copyrighted images

Don't use them, even in internal documents. Don't
alter a copyrighted image and use it. Instead, search for and use public
domain <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0" target="_blank">CC0 Images</a>

## Accessibility

While you may not be required to follow <a href="http://www.508checker.com/what-is-508-compliance" target="new"> Section 508</a>
![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png) guidelines, some clients might be 
required to comply with Section 508. They may expect or require
vendors to comply as well. The broad requirement is that
any information presented in an image must also be presented in an
alternative format (for people who cannot view images).

The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_new">W3CÂ Web Accessibility initiative</a>
![](Resources/Images/offsite-link.png) is a
good resource for all web accessibility issues.

Every image presented online must have alt text describing the image.
Additionally, any text that appears in the image must also appear in the
alt text. Most screen readers already add *Image of* when reading out an
image, so alt text like *Image of Edit Citation dialog box* is redundant
because screen readers will read it *Image of image of edit citation
dialog box*. Try to limit alt text to 15 to 25 words. if you need to have
a longer explanation, add it to the page as a description for the action
involved.

When captioning an image, don't add additional context or information.
Don't merely repeat what the user sees by looking at the image. Captions
should increase understanding.
