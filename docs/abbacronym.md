# Abbreviations and acronyms

Abbreviations are any shortened or contracted word or phrase. For
example, writing *2FA* instead of *Two-factor authentication, or *CRM* for
*Customer Relationship Management*.

Acronyms can be pronounced as words, like *NASA* or pronounced as letters, like *CIA*. 

Acronyms can be confusing to readers. They can take readers out of the flow. Don't assume the reader knows what you mean. 
If an acronym is necessary, spell the full word and follow with the acronym in parentheses
on the first reference. For example, *We use a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system to manage all contact and communication with our customers.*

Some acronyms are more recognizable than their full spellings. For
example, *NASA*. In such instances, the acronym alone is acceptable.
