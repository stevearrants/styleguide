# Be concise

Good content should be:

* Specific
* Informative
* Clear and concise
* Brisk but not terse
* Incisive

Be serious but not pompous or emotionless. 
Be frugal with adjectives. They're subjective and make the text sound emotive and inauthentic.

You should:

* Use contractions.
* Avoid unwieldy grammar (for example, say *You can* rather than
    *You may be able to*).
* Use short sentences.
* Use the language and terms your readers use.
* Avoid turning verbs into nouns! That's a symptom of sloppy writing.

## Keep sentences and paragraphs short

If a sentence has more than 25 words, try to split it to make the points more straightforward.

Vary sentence length. This helps keep readers interested and varies your tone. Too many short sentences sound terse and like you're giving orders. Longer sentences also help the flow.

Do the same for paragraphs. If it looks long, it is. Try to break it up. Let's look at some examples. Instead of:

> Generally, we update the software regularly. When an update is scheduled for
> release, we will alert you that it occurred. It is
> your responsibility to ensure you are working with the latest version.

Use:

> We regularly update our software quarterly and notify you when updates are available. Remember that you are responsible for reading the notices.
