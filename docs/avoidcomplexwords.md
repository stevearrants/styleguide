# Avoid Complex Words 

## Use shorter words that aren't ambiguous

Shorter words are often more accurate and less ambiguous. Writers sometimes use 
long, complex words. It's a way to put distance between themselves and the text.
Some writers think the bigger the word, the more authoritative they sound.
Unless certain words or phrases are required due 
to regulation or a corporate guide, use the shorter, simpler word or phrase.
