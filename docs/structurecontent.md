# Structure the content

Most of our documentation is read online. Here are some tips for
presenting it.

## Important information first

Readers tend to scan text until they find the information they need. No
matter how carefully you lay out and write the content, most people only
read 25 percent of it. This shows the importance of getting content
right.

Put the most important information in the first two paragraphs. That's
the section users are most likely to read. In journalism, this technique
is called the "inverted pyramid."

## Break up text

A wall of text overwhelms readers. Use subheads and bullet points as
they provide clear narrative structure for readers in a hurry. Put
information-rich words at the beginning of the phrase and use the
active voice.

Instead of:

> How to validate your changes and find errors

Use:

> Validate your document

Tables are a good way to visualize a lot of data. Long paragraphs with a
lot of names, dates, and other information are much more difficult to
scan than this:

| Dates covered|Report Due|
|---|---|
|January 1--March 31|April  15|
|April 1--June 30|July 15|
|July 1--September 30|October 15|
|October 1--December 31 |January 31|


## What about FAQs?

FAQs are easy to write and structure---too easy. They:

* Can be hard to read and search for
* May duplicate other content on your site
* Mean that content is not where people expect to find it

If you're thinking about posting FAQs, review the content and look for
ways to improve it. Unless there's a compelling reason, avoid FAQs.
