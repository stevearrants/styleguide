# Use plain language

## Our content should be as straightforward as possible

Clear and usable content uses plain language. Plain language makes our
content easier to find, easier for all users to access, and easier to understand.

Many writers use jargon, formal language, and long, complex sentences. These can 
separate the subject and content from the reader. This often leads to misinterpretation and confusion.

Technical documentation should say what you actually mean and make your content
transparent. Remember to describe what you're actually doing. Be specific. Be
clear.

Don't say *Input your response.* Say *Type your response.* Input can have a lot of meanings. Use the specific word.

You're having a conversation with the reader. Don't lecture.

Don't use formal or long words when shorter words say the same
thing. Use *help* instead of *assist*, *about* instead of
*approximately*.

Make your use of plain language into a way of writing.

## Words to avoid

* abort, kill, terminate (except in technical, programming documentation)
* collaborate -- use *working with*
* dialogue is used for conversations, *dialog* is the interface item, as in dialog box
* execute -- use *run* or *do* instead
* in order to -- use *to*
* initiate -- use *start*
* input -- use *type* or *enter* or *select*
* simple or simply. Avoid these as something simple to a power user isn't so simple to a new user. Itâ€™s acceptable in marketing or informal documents, however.
* utilize. *Use* is a better choice.

## What about legal terms?

**Never** rewrite legal information, such as copyright, terms of use
statements, privacy statement, or other document that could open you to
litigation. These documents are express or implied contracts. Ask your
legal department for assistance.
